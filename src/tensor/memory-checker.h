/**
   class ChangeTracker is something we only use in 'debug mode'.  Its purpose is
   to keep track of when data was last changed, to make sure people don't mutate
   data via in-place operations in a way that will invalidate the backprop.
   This is a replacement for the 'version numbering' of Variables used in
   PyTorch, i.e. it's a different way of solving the same problem.  The
   mechanism is (I think) more exact than version numbering, and less hassle for
   the calling code; but since it's slower, we will only activate it
   occasionally.  c.f. SetDebugMode(), GetDebugMode().

   During the forward pass, when an Op records, as members, certain Tensors that
   will be needed during the backprop pass, it also records the time in
   ticks (c.f. GetTick()) at which the forward pass happened.  Then in
   the backward pass, during debug mode we want to check that the memory
   underlying those Tensors has not beeen changed since that recorded tick.
   (If people use in-place operations in an unsupported way, this might
   have happened).

   This class provides a mechanism to do that.  It's actually quite an
   interesting mathematical problem as it involves detecting overlap between
   patterns in memory and we want to do it efficiently, not using a huge array.
   Note: in debug mode, any time a memory region underlying a tracked Variable's
   data is written to (whether or not that write actually went through a tracked
   Variable or even a regular Tensor), we record the change (see member function
   RecordChange()).

/**
   The purpose of this class is to check for use of invalidated data.  It will
   only be used when debug mode is enabled.

   This is a checking mechanism that helps us to fairly safely avoid certain
   unnecessary operations on parts of Variables in the backprop phase.  (If the
   check fails, user-level code will have to be changed).  It's best illustrated
   with an example.  Let A and B both be Variables representing 2x2 matrices
   that have been freshly created with uninitialized data.  Suppose we do:

      (1) Initialize A's data to something requiring derivative tracking
      (2) Copy A to B
      (3) Copy A to B again
      (4) Do something that depends on the value of B

   In the backprop, when doing the backprop of operation (3), after propagating
   the derivative back to A we'd need to zero out the first row of B's
   derivative matrix, to reflect the fact that its value before operation (3)
   doesn't affect the outcome; otherwise after the backprop of (2) we would have
   twice the value we should really have for the derivative w.r.t. A.  So
   naively, any time we do the backprop for an operation that writes to a
   variable that was already tracked at the time we did that operation, we would
   have to zero out that part of the derivative matrix afterwards.  But much of
   the time we wouldn't have previously written to that part of memory, so such
   zeroing would be wasteful.  (Note: we can't just rely on checking whether or
   not this base Variable has previously had an operation done on it; the hard
   case is where there are multiple Variables that are sub-parts of the same
   base Variable).

   The way we handle this is: we assume by default that any time we do an
   operation that sets a Variable but does not depend on its previously existing
   value, the memory underlying it has not been previously written to in an
   operation that required derivative-tracking.  That is, the framework assumes
   by default that you DO NOT REUSE MEMORY, except for in-place operations.  If
   you do want to re-use memory (specifically:a if you do something that does
   require overwriting previously-written data that required derivative
   tracking, like the above), you can inform the framework that you plan to do
   this as follows:
     DoSomethingWith(a, b, &c.Overwrite());
   instead of
     DoSomethingWith(a, b, &c);
   (here a, b and c are Variables; and let's suppose this operation
   DoSomethingWith() ignores the previous value of `c`).

   This purpose of class InvalidatedDataChecker is to detect cases where someone
   should have invoked Overwrite() because tracked data was overwritten, but
   failed to do so.

   See also the comment for the overwrite_ member of class VariableImpl, and
   the Untouched() member of Variable.
