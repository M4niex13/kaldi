/**
   A Tensor is a multi-dimensional array (up to 5 dimensions) of types such as
   float or double (and eventually ints).  Multiple Tensors may point to data
   allocated from the same Storage.  Class Tensor contains enough elements that
   it makes sense most of the time to pass it around by reference (Tensor&) or
   by pointer (e.g. Tensor* or std::shared_pointer<Tensor>).  This is unlike
   in PyTorch where there is a separate TensorImpl class and Tensor really just
   contains a pointer to it.

   Most of the operations that you would do on a Tensor (like addition,
   multiplication and so on) are declared out-of-line in tensor-functions.h.
