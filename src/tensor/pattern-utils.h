void RemoveTrivialAxes(Pattern *pattern);


/**
   This function returns a code that compactly represents information about
   which axes had dim != 1; which axis, if any, had stride == 1; and
   whether any axis had stride < 0.

   Let
      n = 0 if no axis had stride=1, otherwise:
      n = 1 + the raxis index which had stride=1.

    (raxis is the axis index when accessing the axes in reversed order, as
     stored in pattern.dims and pattern.strides).

   For example if the strides were [10,3,1] we would have
   n = 1; i if the strides were [10,1,3] we would have n = 2.

   IMPORTANT NOTE ON ORDERING: lists of dims or strides in square
   brackets, like [1,2], are in the non-reversed ordering as exposed
   by the Tensor API.

   The value 'n' occupies the bits starting from 8 in the returned code,
   i.e. bits 8,9,10 (counting from the right, i.e. from the least to
   most significant).

   Bit 11 is 1 if any of the strides were negative, and zero otherwise.
   (None of the example bit-patterns below have this bit set.)  The
   underlying BLAS in most cases does not support negative strides so
   we deal with it by copying the data to a temporary with positive
   strides.

   The low-order KALDI_TENSOR_MAX_DIM bits have a 1 corresponding to
   axes where dim != 1, and a 0 if dim == 1 for that axis.  Axis zero
   in the private numbering (equal to the highest-numbered axis in the
   public numbering) is the rightmost/lowest-order of these bits.

   The explanation below will use c++14 binary literals (like 0b010101), although the code
   doesn't use them as we compile as c++11; we show the corresponding hex codes which
   are used in the code (and anyway easier to parse).

   In the notation below, in dims vectors, x or X is a stand-in for 'any number
   not equal to 1', and upper-case X indicates that the axis has stride=1.  In
   the example `dims` vectors below, we don't put any leading `dim=1` axes,
   because they would not affect the code generated.  The list of numbers
   in square brackets [] below may be interpreted as the sequence of dims for the
   Tensor, in the non-reversed ordering that the Tensor API exposes.

   The ' at the 8th bit is to make the bit-string easier to parse.

    0b000'00000001  0x001  dims=[x], a vector with a stride

   (the curly braces in our notation imply that we are referring to the reversed
   ordering physically used in 'pattern', but actually this doesn't affect
   anything since the order of axes does not matter here as long as it is constent.

/**
   Compresses a Pattern by removing or combining as many axes as possible,
   while preserving the memory-index-set of the pattern (see glossary for
   explanation), and also while respecting certain invariances that are relevant
   when constructing 'views' ('view' is PyTorch terminology; the NumPy
   equivalent is 'reshape').  The "C" in the function name refers to C-style
   arrays.  Basically what this function does is a highly restricted subset
   of what CompressOnePattern() does.

   This function removes axes with dim=1.

   This function combines successive axes if the relationship of their
   dims and strides is what you would expect in a "C"-style array
   when the axes are listed in their non-reversed ordering (i.e.
   as exposed by class Tensor).

   Suppose that in pattern 'p' we had two successive axes physically numbered
   raxis, raxis+1, with p->dims[raxis] > 1 and p->dims[raxis+1] > 1
   and p->strides[raxis + 1] == p->strides[raxis] * p->dims[raxis],
   then this function will merge them into a single axis whose dimension
   is the product of the dimensions of the two original axes.
   (However, they won't be merged if it would
   result in a dimension exceeding the range of int32).

   TODO...  finish this if it turns out to be needed for something.
   I'm not sure if it will be.


   The output pattern 'dest' is what you get if you keep applying the
   rules above until no further change is made.

/**
   Creates a Pattern corresponding to a requested 'view' of the matrix.
   ('view' is PyTorch terminology; the NumPy equivalent is 'reshape').

   The PyTorch/NumPy semantics are (I believe) as follows: Firstly, a view
   can/should only be created for a tensor whose layout in memory is as for a
   "C" array; suppose that the shape of array a is (9, 8), a "C" layout would
   imply strides of (8, 1).  A 'view' of this array simply implies interpreting
   the same block of memory as a "C" array with some other sequence of
   dimensions, say (3, 3, 8) or (8, 9) or (1, 72); any sequence whose product
   matches the number of elements in "a".

   Our semantics of "view" is the same as that of PyTorch/NumPy except that we
   impose fewer constraints on what strides the input Tensor cmay have.  Let the
   'view' of the array 'a' be 'b'.  As long as it is possible to find a tensor
   pattern for 'b' that would lead to the same relationship between the elements
   of 'a' and 'b' as what you would get by asking for the same "view" in
   PyTorch/NumPy assuming 'a' had had "C"-style strides (viewed in terms of
   indexed elements of and b, without regard to the physical memory layout), we
   allow it.


   Notes on implementation (glossing over ones in 'dims' which are easy to
   handle as a special case): we would first call CompressPattern on
   'pattern_in'.  Then we would attempt to find a correspondence with
   the dimensions of this compressed pattern and a partition of the
   sequence 'dims'.  For example, suppose the compressed pattern
   is (100, 9) and dims is (50, 2, 3, 3), then the partition would
   be (50, 2), (3, 3).  If this is not possible (e.g. if dims
   had been (30,10,3) instead), we return false.

   @param [in]  pattern_in   The input pattern for which we are trying to
                          find an alternative view
   @param [in]  dims  The sequence of dimensions corresponding to the
                      desired view.  Its product must be the same as the
                      product of pattern_in.dims.
   @param [out] pattern_out  The output pattern, if we were
                      successful (otherwise undefined).  Its 'dims'
                      will be the same as 'dims'.
   @return           Returns true on success (i.e. such a view could be
                     created), and false otherwise.  This function will
                     never return false if 'pattern_in' had strides as
                     for a "C" array (i.e., if HasCStrides(pettern_in)
