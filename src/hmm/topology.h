/*
  The following would be the text form for the "normal" 3-state HMM topology/
  "bakis model", with the typical reordering that we do to improve the
  compactness of the compiled FSTs.  The format is the OpenFst acceptor format.
  The fields are, for transitions,
  <from-state> <to-state> <pdf-class> <transition-cost>
 and, for final-states,
  <state> <final-cost>

  The <transition-cost> may be interpreted as negative log probabilities.
  We normally set them so as to sum to one, in order to keep the fully
  compiled (HCLG) graph fairly stochastic (meaning: sum-to-one, like an
  HMM).

  The integers on the arcs, which we call 'pdf-classes', define which
  arcs share the same "pdf" and which ones are distinct.

  Preconditions on topology:
     - pdf-classes (3rd field on arcs) must
       form a contiguous list of numbers starting from 1, although
       different arcs with the same pdf-class are allowed.  (We avoid 0
       because it is "special" in OpenFST, it is used for epsilon).
     - The start state must be state 0 and there must be no
       transitions entering it except (possibly) a self-loop (although
       a self-loop on state 0 is not advised for decoding-graph-size
       reasons)
     - The start state must not be final.
     - No phone (in the <ForPhones>...</ForPhones> block) may have the value 0.


 <Topology>
 <TopologyEntry>
 <ForPhones> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 </ForPhones>
 0  1  1  0.0
 1  1  1  0.693
 1  2  2  0.693
