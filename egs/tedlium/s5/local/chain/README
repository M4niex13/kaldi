These are instruction to reproduce the TEDLIUM models described in
"Purely sequence-trained neural networks for ASR based on lattice-free
MMI", by Povey et al.

First run:

./run.sh

until the end of stage 7. (local/nnet/run_dnn.sh can be skipped.)

Then run:

local/chain/run_tdnn.sh

to see results for a generic chain model (these were not the results
shown in the paper; the script describes hyperparameter settings
needed to achieve those results).
