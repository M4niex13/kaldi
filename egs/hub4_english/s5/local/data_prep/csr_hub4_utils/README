SOFTWARE ACCOMPANYING CSR LM DATA
---------------------------------

The files in this directory fall into three categories:

(1) C source code (*.c)

(2) Perl source code (*.perl)

(3) shell scripts and auxiliary data files

In general, program summaries are provided within the source files, and are
often printed on stderr by the programs when the user enters some
unsuitable command line option (e.g. -h).  The "do-lm" shell script shows
the components that were used in the LM-conditioning pipeline; other perl
programs were used for data summaries and correction of minor glitches.
See INVENTORY for more information.

For further information on these programs, please contact Robert MacIntyre
or David Graff at the Linguistic Data Consortium:

While disclaimers have not been systematically placed in all source
code files, users are expected to understand that the following
applies to all source code files in this directory, unless otherwise
noted in particular files:
