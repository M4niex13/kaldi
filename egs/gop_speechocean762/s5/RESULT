In the `speechocean762` corpus, the phoneme-level scores are in three levels:
2: pronunciation is correct
1: pronunciation is right but has a heavy accent
0: pronunciation is incorrect or missed

Firstly, we can treat the scoring as a regression task.
So, MSE(Mean Square Error) and Corr(Cross-correlation) are computed:

MSE: 0.13
Corr: 0.44

Then we round the continuous predicted scores into [0, 1, 2] to treat the scoring
as a classification task.
So, the classification metrics like precision, recall, and f1-score are computed
and printed by `sklearn.metrics.classification_report`:


              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.64      0.09      0.15      1339
