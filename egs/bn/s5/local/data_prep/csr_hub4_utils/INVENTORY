	Introduction to the tools.
abbrlist
abbrproc.perl
	Part of LM conditioning pipeline.
	Spells out abbreviations and such.
	"abbrlist" is an auxiliary data file for abbrproc.
addressforms
	auxiliary file used by "sentag.c"
artfilter.perl
	Selects articles based on content of SGML tags.
bugproc.perl
	Part of LM conditioning pipeline.
	Corrects a few common typos and non-standard spellings.
do-lm
	Bourne shell script that executes language modeling conditioning
	pipeline.
eval-material.ptrns
	Pattern file used to separate reserved "test" (evaluation) articles
	from "train" articles (training material).  Used with "artfilter"
	program along the following lines:
	    foreach $file
		artfilter.perl -t program -f eval-material.ptrns -v -r \
		 $file.test $file > $file.train
num_excp
numhack.perl
numproc.perl
	Part of LM conditioning pipeline.
	Spells out numberical expressions.
	"num_excp" is an auxiliary data file for numproc.
	"numhack.perl" is a new module for phone numbers and zip codes.
pare-sgml.perl
	Part of LM conditioning pipeline.
	Removes extraneous SGML tagging and transcriber comments enclosed
	in brackets.
progsummary.perl
	extracts program information from sgml-ized PSM texts
puncproc.perl
	Part of LM conditioning pipeline.
	Verbalizes punctuation (or removes, with -np switch).
sent-init.vocab
sentag.c
	Program used to tag sentences in "raw" version.
	Revised since last CSR_LM95 to handle over-long
	sentences/paragraphs and to pass material lacking any obvious
	end-of-sentence markers or alphabetic characters, since the
	transcriptions are more likely to contain such text.  Uses
	auxiliary "sent-init.vocab" file.
tr-bn-char.fast.perl
tr-bn-char.slow.perl
	Program used to translate 8-bit character encoding occasionally
	found in the documents.  The two versions should be identical in
	output; the "slow" version is more readable while the "fast"
	version is more efficient.
