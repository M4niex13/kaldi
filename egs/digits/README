This is an audio + language model + acoustic data dataset  that is suitable 
for use with Wit Zieli≈Ñski's 

CREATING A SIMPLE ASR SYSTEM IN KALDI TOOLKIT FROM 
SCRATCH USING SMALL DIGITS CORPORA
IN OTHER WORDS: KALDI FOR DUMMIES

tutorial, as seen at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kaldi-help/tzyCwt7zgMQ/wvCLpVVpBgAJ

I obtained the audio by cutting spoken digits out of English-language recitations 
of pi found on Youtube.*

In addition to the audio, this dataset contains all the langugage model and 
acoustic data files referenced by Chapters 5 and 6 in Kaldi for Dummies. If you
want to use it, you must do all the other steps yourself.

It is very nearly exactly as described in the tutorial's Exemplary Project.  There
are only two changes:

1) I've added 'o' to the lexicon because some participants say 'oh' instead of 'zero'.
2) The audio is sampled at 44.1kHz, and the default in the project tools is 16kHz,  
   so to use this audio you will need to add this line to your mfcc.conf:

   --sample-frequency 44100 

Using this audio, I've managed to successfully run the tutorial, getting word 
error rates of 30%ish.

* Distribution of this audio isn't super compatible with the Youtube Standard License, 
which permits streaming only, so if you think about republishing it somewhere, 
please consider that.
