About the sprakbanken corpus:
This corpus is a free corpus originally collected by NST for ASR purposes and currently hosted by the Norwegian libraries. The corpus is multilingual and contains Swedish, Norwegian (Bokm√•l) and Danish. This setup uses the Norwegian subcorpus and it is created by me, Thodoris Kouzelis, from the original Sprakbanken-recipe which uses the Danish subcorpus. The vocabulary is large and there is approx. 520 hours of read-aloud speech with associated text scripts.
