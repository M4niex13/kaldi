The recipe scripts in this folder has been removed under based on the request
from Dan as this recipe is at an older version compared to "s5b". If you are 
interested in running experiments based on this "s5" recipe, you could download
all the scripts from the SWC website (version "v1" under the recipe page):

	http://mini-vm20.dcs.shef.ac.uk/swc/Kaldi_recipe.html

or you could clone from Yulan's git (master branch):
